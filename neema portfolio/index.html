          <h2 class="mb-3">About</h2>

          <p class="lead mb-5" style="line-height: 2rem">
            I am a PhD Candidate in the Joint Social Work program at the North
            Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) and
            University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). My research
            interests lie at the intersection of climate change and human
            migration, and how the resulting immigration policies & impact
            refugees and immigrants. My ultimate goal is to work in academia,
            where I can become a tenure track professor at a research based
            university as well as teach and mentor graduate and undergraduate
            students. As a first generation immigrant in the United States, I am
            passionate about contributing to research that addresses the mental
            and physical well being of immigrants and refugees. I serve as a
            Fellow at the Center for New North Carolinians (CNNC) - an
            organization in which academics,professionals, and practitioners
            undertake community-based research, advocacy, education,outreach,
            and practice related to refugees and immigrants in the state of
            North Carolina. I believe that community engagement and activism are
            central to making a difference in the community as well as my role
            as a future academician and researcher.

              <div>
                I have had the pleasure of teaching as a graduate student as
                well as an adjunct faculty member, and these experiences have
                instilled in me a genuine passion for teaching. The quote, “To
                educate as the practice of freedom is a way of teaching that
                anyone can learn” (hooks, 1994) has guided my beliefs and
                teaching philosophy. Throughout my classroom experiences, I have
                adopted a teaching style that inspires and empowers the student.
                It is vital for me to facilitate and inspire a student’s
                learning in such a way that their thought-processes transcend
                the boundary of pure knowledge acquisition and extend into the
                realm of intellectual curiosity. I have organized my teaching
                philosophy around four main principles: (1) Teaching should give
                students and teachers the opportunity to challenge and question
                boundaries; (2) Teaching should embrace multiculturalism; (3)
                Teaching should be engaging, stimulating, and allow for
                opportunities to interact; and (4) Teaching is an ongoing
                process that should allow for transformation. These principles
                shape my approach to teaching, both in a virtual and physical
                classroom environment.<br /><br />
                My beliefs about teaching and learning are based on my personal
                experiences as an adult learner, an immigrant, and a black
                female. Throughout my teaching experiences, I have adopted
                teaching practices that I found most effective. In particular, I
                appreciate teaching and learning that embraces the inclusion of
                new ideas, possibilities, and multiculturalism.<br /><br />
                <span style="font-weight: 600"
                  >Teaching should give students and teachers the opportunity to
                  challenge and question boundaries.</span
                >
                I believe that education is a powerful tool that gives both
                students and teachers the opportunity to free the mind and look
                for possibilities. In the classroom, I challenge students to
                think beyond traditional boundaries. During the very first
                lecture in any course, I typically ask each student to share
                with the class how they have come to believe what they believe
                about their world. Through this process of self identification,
                students come to realize and recognize the boundaries that form
                their belief systems. I then give them the opportunity to
                challenge those boundaries. Through discussions with each other,
                an awareness of other perspectives takes place and growth is
                achieved.<br /><br />
                <span style="font-weight: 600"
                  >Teaching should embrace multiculturalism.</span
                >
                It is important to me that my students learn to appreciate
                multiculturalism so that they can cherish and welcome
                perspectives different from the ideas with which they are
                already familiar. I strive to create a classroom atmosphere that
                welcomes and embraces different perspectives and experiences.
                This is important because it is only through mutual respect and
                acceptance that students and teachers can freely share ideas and
                experiences. I strive to ensure that my students feel their
                differences, be they racial, gender, or sexual orientation, are
                assets that are embraced and nurtured in my class. It is through
                the recognition and acceptance of our differences that fear,
                bias, and apprehension can be eliminated. As social workers, it
                is critical that my students are prepared to work with diverse
                populations. In my class, I aspire to utilize case studies and
                role plays that are inclusive of different cultural beliefs and
                practices.<br /><br />
                <span style="font-weight: 600">
                  Teaching should be engaging, stimulating and allow for
                  opportunities to interact.</span
                >
                It is important to me that I design class activities that allow
                for students to engage in critical dialogue with one another.
                Such dialogues enable students to share different perspectives
                on the subject matter as well as practice how to effectively
                present ideas. I believe this approach is particularly powerful
                as it instills in students the notion that their voices can and
                should be heard. <br /><br />
                <span style="font-weight: 600"
                  >Teaching is an ongoing process that should allow for
                  transformation.</span
                >
                I believe that teaching is always evolving, and by default a
                teacher must be a life-long student. As a teacher, I may not
                have a response to every inquiry; however, I know where to seek
                the information I need. As a life-long student, I welcome my own
                learning, through discussions and feedback from the students, as
                much as they learn from me. <br /><br />
                In summary, I desire to be a teacher that invests in my students
                beyond the classroom setting. I deliberately arrive ten minutes
                before class begins so I can have the opportunity to meet and
                chat with students about their work or simply about what is
                going on in their lives. In addition, I make sure I am
                accessible to my students through onsite and virtual office
                hours and encourage them to reach out to me when needed.<br /><br />
